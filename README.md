# Quidax Market Depth API ðŸ“Š

A Spring Boot REST API that fetches the live order book (market depth) for a specific cryptocurrency market from the public Quidax API.

This service is specifically designed to handle the Quidax API's efficient data structure, where individual orders are sent as JSON arrays `(["price", "volume"])`, and provides a clean, developer-friendly JSON object as output.

## Features
- Fetches the complete, real-time order book (bids and asks) for a given market.
- Correctly models and parses the complex nested and array-based JSON from the Quidax depth endpoint.
- Built with a clean, layered architecture (Controller, Service, DTO).

## Technologies Used
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3
- Jackson Annotations (`@JsonFormat`, `@JsonPropertyOrder`)
- Maven
- Lombok
